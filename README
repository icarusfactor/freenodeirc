While some extensions are maintained by MediaWiki's developers, others were
written by third-party developers. As a result, many have bugs, and they are not
all guaranteed to be compatible with each other. Some are unmaintained; not all
extensions work on all versions of MediaWiki. Use any extension, especially
those tagged as insecure, at your own risk. When using an extension requiring
patches to the core MediaWiki code or entries in your database(s), be sure to
create a back-up of your database and/or the core MediaWiki code, to avoid the
risk of permanently breaking your wiki.

Install your extension.

    Generally, at the end of the LocalSettings.php file (but above the PHP
    end-of-code delimiter, "?>", if present), the  following line should be
    added:
        require_once( "$IP/extensions/extension_name/extension_name.php" );

        Ensure that required permissions are set for extensions!
